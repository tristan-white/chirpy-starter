> **bonanza** [b*uh*-**nan**-n*uh*]: a source of great and sudden wealth or luck
{: .prompt-info}

Over the past couple years I began diving into the credit card points game, and let me tell you: **it got wild**.

*How wild,* you ask?

Since I began my credit card journey in May 2022, I've saved **$6,000** and am projected to save **$13,000** over the next 3 years.[^1]

To quote my friends:
- *Tristan, you have a problem.*

- *This needs to stop.*

- *How is this legal?*

<input type="number" id="number2">

<button onclick="mult()">Multiply</button>
<div id="result"></div>

    function mult() {
        var num1 = document.getElementById('number1').value;
        var num2 = document.getElementById('number2').value;
        var f1 = parseFloat(num1);
        var f2 = parseFloat(num2);
        var result = f1 * f2;
        document.getElementById('result').innerText = 'Result : ' + result;
    }
</script>

## Military Perks
While the perks afforded by the credit cards in this post are certainly decent if used optimally, the benefits of these cards goes from "hm, not bad" to "gee whiz this can't be legal" if you're in the military and can get the annual fees waived.
