Over the past couple years I began diving into the credit card points game, and let me tell you: **it got wild**.

*How wild*, you ask.

Since I began researching and opening credit cards a bit over two years ago, I've saved **$9,740** and am projected to save about **$20,000** more over the next three years. 

If I myself were reading this article two years ago and saw those numbers, I'd call BS. So let's break down those numbers and see how this possible.

## Military Benefits

While the perks afforded by the credit cards in this post are certainly decent if used optimally, the benefits of these cards goes from "hm, I think these benefits may be worth the annual fee" to "gee whiz how is this possible" if you're in the military; this is all because the **annual fees for many credit cards are waived for military members**. This is due to the [Military Lending Act](https://ncua.gov/regulation-supervision/manuals-guides/federal-consumer-financial-protection-guide/compliance-management/lending-regulations/military-lending-act-mla) (MLA) and the [Servicemembers Civil Relief Act](https://www.militaryonesource.mil/financial-legal/personal-finance/servicemembers-civil-relief-act/) (SCRA). 

That's right - active duty, or national guard and reserves on 30 day active duty orders (and their military spouses!) can open top tier credit cards such as the [Amex Platinum](#american-express-platinum-card), [Amex Gold](#american-express-gold-card), [Chase Sapphire Reserve](#chase-sapphire-reserve-card), and the [Chase Sapphire Preffered](#chase-sapphire-preferred-card) and **pay no annual fees**.

For example, after receiving my Amex Platinum Card and Chase Sapphire Reserve Card I received letters in the mail that said the following:

> We approved your credit card account for benefits under the Military Lending Act (MLA) and Chase policy...**We won't charge you applicable fees**, other than late fees and non-sufficient funds fees...We review your account annually to verify your eligibility for MLA benefits and will notify you of changes.<br>--Chase Military Servicing Team

> ...because your account is eligible for reief under either the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act or the Military Lending Act, **we will continue to waive your Annual Membership Fee** and any Additional Card Fees as long as your Account continues to qualify. Although these fees will be waived, the terms listed above are applicable and will display in future disclosures and your Cardmember Agreement.<br>--American Express Customer Care

But if there are no fees for military members...then why not get a ton of cards?

That's a great question! And I can't think of a good reason not to do just that. Currently I'm collectively getting **$3,585** of annual fees waived across seven different credit cards.

## How It Started

> Money makes money. And the money that money makes, makes money.<br>-- Ben Franklin

![](/assets/images/million_page.png){: .right .w-50 w="300"}

In second grade I came across a children's book called *If You Made a Million*, which is essentially about how money makes money. Since then, I've always been fascinated by compound interest, passive income, travel hacking, and any other means by which to save a dollar in order to make it start working for me.

Naturally, at some point I began looking into credit card "deals" to see if there were really any deals to be had. As someone who once received a paper plate award for "Most Likely to Cross a Desert for a Dollar", I was certainly going into my research with a healthy amount of skepticism. I avoid subscription fees like the plague, so would I really find any top tier credit cards worth their annual fees?

Short answer: **Yes**

Longer answer: [**The Amex Platinum Card**](#american-expressplatinum-card) is amazing.

Longest answer: If you're in the military, the benefits you stand to leverage from credit cards are near endless.

## Benefits For You, Plain and Simple.
