You noticed if this is isn't your first time here.

I really appreciate good free services, and GitHub Pages is one of them; that's what I use to host this website for free. GitHub Pages uses a Static Site Generator called Jekyll to turn text fils into websites. I was using a jekyll theme called [no-style-please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) for awhile, but there were some limitations with it that made me decided to switch to [chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy). Chirpy has many features that no-style-please does not, namely:

- Better Search Engine Optimization
- Support for Mermaid diagrams and flowgraphs
- Built-in search
- Last Modified Date
- Pinned posts
- Stylized support for code blocks
- More frequent updates
